## Code review by UH 2024-01-04
- The movement of the cornichons is nice and it is kind of fun to play.
- The table with the times grows so large it is no displayed any more.
  - Just count the points and store them with a user name in the localStorage.
  - Display a leaderboard
- Remove all German comments and describe your intention
- Use proper names for all variables, functions and folders (e.g. PNG)
- Get the createCornichon() function running with the given hints. Try first to write the method in a way that it is called once when the game starts. Then think about when multiple cornichons should be created. Work with appendChild and removeChild.
- Let the user adjust the difficulty or change the difficulty after completing a level.
